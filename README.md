# diff-bench-paper
Edits to the supplementary data of the difference recurrence alignment paper.

The original paper by Hajime Suzuki and Masahiro Kasahara is
[here](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2014-8).

This repo exists because [diffbench](https://github.com/ocxtal/diffbench)
did not contain the exact code for the benchmarks in the paper.
I needed to modify this code to compare against
[block aligner](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/block-aligner).
