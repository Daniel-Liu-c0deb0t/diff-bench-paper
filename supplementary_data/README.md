# Supplementary Data

## Contents

This archive contains supplementary data for "Suzuki and Kasahara, Introducing difference recurrence relations for faster semi-global alignment of long sequences."

* sequences.txt: input sequence pairs, the same file as `https://github.com/ocxtal/diffbench/blob/master/seq/pair.window.20.32.25k.txt`.
* bench\_table1.txt: raw data of Table 1.
  * bench_table1.xlsx: contains the same data as bench_table1.txt, with GCUPS calculation.
* bench\_figure4.txt: raw data of Figure 4 (The average computation time in microseconds for the four implementations).
* bench\_supplementary_tableS1.txt: raw data of Table S1 in supplementary\_document.pdf (referred as Additional file 1 in the manuscript).
  * hgc,mac,nuc,ryzen: contains results on the four systems. We used the third result of each file to compose bench_supplementary_tableS1.txt.
* benchmark\_codes: codes and scripts used in the benchmark. clone of https://github.com/ocxtal/diffbench (commit: 9f28b170184e3b3ef5a1e0c39f8d4de684500643).
